***Some notes:***
* This requires a server for two reasons:
  * The desire to keep the source documents as plaintext files
  * The desire to have it rendered server-side

***Todo:***
* Support alternate translations (currently only uses Ogden).
* Fix the stripped formatting
* LaTeX support (for equation formatting)
